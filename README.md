Done:
1. **CoolWidget:**
   - It's a styled text box used twice, one with a playful message.

2. **CounterWidget:**
   - It starts at 33, and you can hit the 'Decrement' button to bring the counter down.
   - The counter logic is handled in a stateful widget. There's a text box displaying the current counter value, and each tap on the 'Decrement' button triggers a decrease.

3. **App Style:**
   - Achieved a modern look with rounded corners and a gradient background for a fresh vibe.

4. **App Bar:**
   - The title's set to "Flutter HW2."

5. **Run It:**
   - On flutter, run the emulator(if you have huge amount of RAM, ofc) and run the main app.

Simple stuff, but there's a bit of cool logic in the counter widget. Cheers! ðŸš€
